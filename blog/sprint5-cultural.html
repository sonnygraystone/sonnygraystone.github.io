<h1>Reflections</h1>

<h3>
    What are three new things you have learnt about yourself and your ego as a result of the core learning?</h3>

<p>
    I have learned to adapt a positive mentality as I try to not get disheartened or too down on myself when learning new stuff that I do not immediately understand. I've adopted the mindset that altough I may not understand it yet I will learn it.

    I've also learned that sometimes my ego can make me feel like I'm cheating when looking at someone else code for the same problem I'm stuck on because I didn't come up with it myself, I have found that this is a great way to learn as long as I'm undetstanding what the code is doing.

    Lastly I have learned that when faced with a problem I am not able to immedaitely solve and if I'm stuck on it for a while then taking a break and steping away from my computer can be a great tool to adjust my mindset so that I can think of a different approach to the solution. Sometimes a shift in perspective brings everything into focus.

<h3>What are the role of values, empathy, and self awareness in learning and programming?
</h3>

<p>
    Values are what you place important on so if you value learning then you re more likely to put in effort when learning new skills. Empathy is important as programming can be frustating at times so it's likely that co-workers/peers will be also dealing with presure/frustration, having empathy can help with understanding peoples feelings which can lead to a more productive work environment. Self awareness is important as knowing when to take a step back and not push is a great skill to have.
</p>

<h3>What has surprised you the most about the core learning?
</h3>

<p>
    That our brains physically change as a result of our learning and and that new pathways are constantly being altered.
</p>

<h3>
    What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?
</h3>

<p>
    Raising my level of self-awareness, self-evaluate, and doing this consistently.
</p>

<h3>
    Why do you think that we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web development bootcamp course?
</h3>

<p>
    As this will allow us to work better as part of a group and as individuals. Therefore, making us more valuable to a company compared to a person who knows how to write code but not work well with others. This is turn will make us better fit in a company and have a higher chance of being hired.

</p>

<h3>Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practise programming instead? Justify your answer.

</h3>

<p>
    No, it does not feel like a waste of time, the core content is tough sometimes and requires a lot of thinking but I can see the massive amount of value that I get out of it. It has already raised my level of self-awareness and I can see how this can really help later on when starting is this industry.

<h3>
    What is your long term goal and/or career pathway?
</h3>
<p>
My long term goal is to either become a full stack web developer or a software developer. I'm hoping dev academy is able to set me up with the required skills necessiary to succeed.
</p>

<h3>
    What do you think your biggest strengths and limitations will be in Bootcamp?
</h3>
<p>
As mentioned during previous sprints I am eager to learn which should be  great sterngth to have during bootcamp. My main limitation is getting distracted, during foundations I've found that I've been taking longer and longer breaks inbetween work sessions however I think once I'm on campus it'll be easier to focus on the work with less distractions being present.
</p>

<h3>
    What do you think your biggest non-technical challenge at Bootcamp will be?
</h3>

<p>
I think my biggest challenge will be the social aspect, getting to know everyone and working in teams when I'm unfamilar with the material can be challenging
</p>

<h3>
    What non-technical skills - human skills - would you like to see developed in yourself while at EDA?
</h3>

<p>
    During my time at EDA I'd like to improve on my communication skills as there are times when I stuggle to communicate my ideas and I end up just being not verbal.
</p>

<h3>
    What are your expectations of yourself on Bootcamp
</h3>

<p>
    I expect my self to be dedicated and disciplined when approaching the work load ensuring that I use all available resources to achevie this.
