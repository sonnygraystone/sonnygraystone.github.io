<h3> What is your long term goal and or career pathway? </h3>        
<p>
    My long term goal is to become a full stack developer.
</p>


<h3>
    What skills (non-technical - human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at EDA?
</h3>
<p>
    During my time at EDA I would like to focus on improving my interpersonal skills such as my ability to communicate ideas.
</p>

<h3>
    A description of your own strengths and limitations
</h3>
<p>
    One of my main strengths is that I am flexible so I’m able to adjust to change well and can generally pick things up quickly.
    One of my limitations is that I can sometimes get distracted easily which leads to work being completed later then expected
</p>


<h3>
    Based on the above description, a commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme. This should include - an explanation of how you will manage yourself to work productively and safely with other learners, facilitators and industry/community representatives.
</h3>

<p>
    I have set aside time blocks on weekdays to complete my tasks with additional time on the weekend as needed.
</p>


<h3>
    A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way.
</h3>

<p>
    I will conduct my own resarch to begin with using available resourses. In the evenet that this does not yeild fruit then I will reach out to my peers/faciliators.
</p>


<h3>
    A description of what you expect from the facilitation team
</h3>

<p>
    I hope the facilitation team will provide me with the support and guidance when neccessairy.
</p>

<h3>
    Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things. For example, you might have whanau commitments such as school drop-offs. It’s important to plan these in.
</h3>
<p>
I have very few commitments at this time, the ones I do have are flexible to change so I'm able to focus on getting through bootcamp.
