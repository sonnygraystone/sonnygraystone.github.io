<h3>
    An analogy to describe the differences between HTML and CSS
</h3>

<p>
    An analogy to describe the difference between HTML & CSS would be to imagine a house. HTML is the equivelent to the building blocks. i.e the structure like the conrete and the timber. CSS is everything ontop of the struture that gives the house substance e.g. the paint on the walls, all of the interior design & all of the decorations.

<h3>
    What is the DOM?
</h3>

<p>
The Document Object Model, is a tree-like structure that allows programmers to conceptualize hierarchy and access the elements on a web page.

The DOM is a logical tree-like Model that organizes a web pageâ€™s HTML Document as an Object.

The DOM is a language-agnostic structure implemented by browsers to allow for web scripting languages, like JavaScript, to access, modify, and update the structure of an HTML web page in an organized way.

The DOM is the link between an HTML web page and scriping langauges.

<h3>
    Explain control flow and loops using an example process from everyday life.
</h3>

<p>
    Control flow is the order in wich statements are executed within a program. The default control flow is for statesments to be read and executed in order from left to right and top to bottom.
    Control structures such as conditional statements are able to alter the flow by only executing blocks of code if certain conditions are met. These structures allow a program to make decisions about which code is executred as the program runs.
    An analogy for a control flow would be doing the dishes, the end result is for the object to be clean so steps are followed for that result to occur, like rinsing a plate, scrubbing the plate, washing the plate, drying the place. If one of these steps is not completed properly they are able to go back and reapply one of the steps again - this same concept exists within conditional statements.

<h3>
    Explain the difference between accessing data from arrays and objects.
</h3>

<p>
 Arrays and objects are both used in javaScript to store data. There are a few differences between the two.

The biggest advantage to using an array is that data is stored in an ordered collection in which data is able to be accesed using a numerical index. They are also changable and can also be modified at any index
Objects - Objects are used when you want to organize data based on the key/value pairs. Similar to a book the chapter title is the key and the chapter contents are the value so you can easily get to a chapters contents by acessing the key.

<h3>
    Explain what functions are and why they are useful
</h3>

<p>
    Functions are a self contained block of code that perform a task or calculate a value. Functions are useful as this piece of code can be accessed and reused over and over again whenever the same functionality is required within the program.
