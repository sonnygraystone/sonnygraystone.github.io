<h3>
  A time I got blocked on a simple problem
</h3>
<p>
  One simple problem that I had a block on was during the JS-Olympics step 4 when creating a new object. Even though I had gotten stuck on previous exerices I was overthinking the problem and had spent over an hour googling the problem, the solution was very simple and straightforward.
</p>

<h3>
  A time I solved a problem in an elegent way
</h3>
<p>
  One of the problems I solved in an elegant way was during the Super FizzBuzz challenge, initially I wasn't sure how to approach the problem by using the already written function of fizzbuzz but after some research I found that I could the .map method to loop through the provided array and apply the fizzbuzz function to it which turned out to be super easy and efficient.

<h1>
  Problem solving techniques
</h1>

<h3>
  Pseudocode
</h3>
<p>
  Pseudo code is used to write down in plain english each step of the process to solving the required task.
</p>

<h3>
  Trying Something

</h3>
<p>
  I like this technique of just having a go, if it only partially works, I am still closer to a solution than I was before.
</p>

<h3>
  Rubber Ducky
</h3>
<p>
  This technique is helpful as explaining it outloud to an object in words helps me to reinforce my understsanding by articulating my argument into words.
</p>

<h3>
  Reading error messages
</h3>
<p>
  Error messages are helpful for resolving small issue with code such as syntax errors, generally it hasnt helped me with the overall problem solving
</p>

<h3>
  Console.logging
</h3>
<p>
  logging to console is super helpful as it allows me to see what my code is actually doing which can help break down the problem by isolating each part to show which isn't operating correctly.
</p>

<h3>
  Googling
</h3>
<p>
  Googling is by far my most used problem solving method as I've found that every problem I encounter has a similar solution it's mostly just a matter of googling the correct terms. Google is my primary source when problem solving.
</p>

<h3>
  Asking peers/coaches for help
</h3>
<p>
  Asking for help does not come easy to me, I will however, after I have exhausted all of my other problem-solving skills.

</p>

<h3>
  Improving your process with reflection
</h3>
<p>
  I need to work more on this, as relecting on a problem I've solved can help to reinforce learning gained during that chalenge.
