<h3>
  Evaluate your strengths and limitations in terms of your learning and career development
</h3>
<p>
  My strength is my dependability and flexibility to handle change. Having worked on multiple IT server desks, I was able to adjust and excel in different working environments while building a strong relationships with my peers. As far as limitations, I am working on my. Time management skills, I will always stay late to get everything done, but there are times when better focus and organisation on my part would have lead to the task being completed earlier.

<h3>
  Describe how your culture has influenced your values and identity.
</h3>
<p>
  Growing up in New Zealand has definitely influenced my values and identity. Kiwi are known for their resourcefulness and ingenuity along with being loyal and caring towards their friends, the concept of 'mateship' is something that I have strived towards.

<h3>
  Explain a situation where you have had an ethical decision to make. Discuss how you weighed up the values involved in that decision, the decision you made and the consequences of the action you took.
</h3>

<p>
  During my time studying at university I had a friend who had completed the papers I was taking, they had offered to give me their work to use which I had contemplated taking as it would have greatly reduced my work load. However I decided to decline the offer as I felt it would go against my personal values of integrity and it would have diminished my sense of achievement.
