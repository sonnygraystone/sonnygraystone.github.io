  Neuroplasticity and Growth Mindset
</h1>>

<h3>
  Describe how neuroplasticity is relevant to learning
</h3>
<p>
  neuroplasticity refers to the brains ability to adept to interperate events and both learn and adapt to different expierences. 
</p>

<h3>
  Describe what Growth Mindset is and why it is important
</h3>
<p>
  This growth mindset is important as our environemnts are constantly changing and therefore growth allows us to adapt and overcome external events.  Continously learning helps the brain to stay sharp. 
</p>


<h3>
  Ways to increase neuroplasticity
</h3>
<p>
  There are 5 main ways that are effective in incresing neuroplasticity. 

    The most important step is <b>sleep</b>, allowing our brain enough time to rest and recover in order to perform.
    <br />
    <b>Continous learning</b> is important as contstant learning prevents stagnation. Learning new skills helps to keep the brain agile and open to change.
    <br />
    <b>exercise</b> is key in increasing neuroplasticity as it helps with both blood flow around the body to the brain as well as an increse in the amount of oxygen recieved into the body and brain which helps with growth.
    <br />
    <b>Stress</b> is the opposite of growth, allowing excess stress to enter your mind can prevent growth as it is replaced with worry.
    Having a task and knowing the <b>purpose</b> or outcome of this event being a desired one can help to increase neuroplasticity as you are more likely to be enganged and motivated to complete the learning.

<h3>
  Discuss what the Growth Mindset is and why it is relevant
</h3>
<p>
  A growth minset is important as individual who believe that their abilities and intelligence can be developed and improved through perseverance from learning and support are more likely to persue growth and continous learning as opposed to someone who belives in a fixed minset (those who believe that intelligence and talents are innate)
</p>


<h3>
  In this exploration, did anything surprise you? Change for you?
</h3>
<p>
  I was surprised by a growth minset, the fact that your minset can have a physical impact on your mind and body.
</p>

<h3>
  How will you integrate growth mindset into your learning journey?
</h3>
<p>
  I have a sense of purpose and am interested in the materials being taught which will help with the increase of the effectiveness of Neuroplasticity. If I struggle with the content provided I will use a growth mindset and will try to learn and understand it
